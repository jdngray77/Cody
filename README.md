# Cody

Cody is a rotational encryption (rot) tool which works by altering charcters based on an offset or 'rot(ation)'.

This is a common and easily researchable encryption method, so I won't explain it here. Just know that
> This method of encryption is functional for leisurely use but is not secure by today's standards, and should not be treated as such.

# Usage 

## Simple

Encrypt and decrpyt with a known key.
